Vector Exercise-2
----------------------

Allways print your solutions to the terminal!
allways access elements of a vector with the .at() function!
1. copy your program from exercise-1 and modify it the following way.
2. add enough new members to the first vector so that it contains the values from 1 to 100 in ascending order!
3. use .back() and front() functions to print out the first and last element of each vector!
4. use the .pop_back() function on every vector!. this should delete the last element of the vector!
5. try to print the the 100th element of the 1st vector using .at(99). Describe what is printed in the terminal and try to explain it!
5.b (bonus only for david): if the whole thing would have been implemented in normal array contruct what would have have happened if you had tried to access an array with a higher index than it was declared for?
eg. 	int [100] numbers;
	std::cout << numbers[102];
